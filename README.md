# Jarvis-like Assistant

This is a basic Jarvis-like voice assistant built using Python. It can recognize voice commands and respond with the current time and date. The project is a starting point for creating a more advanced assistant with additional features.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Listens to voice commands and recognizes them using the `SpeechRecognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to commands by converting text to speech using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Current Time and Date**: Provides the current time and date upon request.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `SpeechRecognition` library
- `pyttsx3` library
- `pyaudio` library

## Installation

1. Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio

## Future Enhancements

This project is a basic starting point. Future enhancements could include:

- Adding more voice commands and responses.
- Integrating with other APIs for more functionalities (e.g., weather, news).
- Implementing natural language processing for better understanding of user commands.
- Improving speech recognition accuracy.
- Adding features like setting reminders, playing music, sending emails, etc.
- Enhancing the user interface for better interaction.
